# Vision AI Bootcamp – Image Recognition Project

This repository contains my final project from the **Vision AI Bootcamp**, where I implemented image classification models using **TensorFlow/Keras** in **Google Colab**. The project progresses from basic CNNs to an optimized transfer learning model for **Cats vs. Dogs**.

## 📂 Datasets Used
- **MNIST** – Handwritten digit recognition
- **CIFAR-10** – 10-class object recognition
- **Cats vs. Dogs** – Binary classification

## 🛠️ Models Implemented
1. **Custom CNNs** for MNIST and CIFAR-10 with Dropout & Batch Normalization
2. **Transfer Learning** with MobileNetV2 for Cats vs. Dogs
3. Fine-tuning for improved accuracy

## 📊 Results & Visualizations

## 🚀 Features
- Image preprocessing & augmentation
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations for metrics and results
- Google Colab compatible code

## 📦 How to Run
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/gauravsoni02/IMAGE_RECOGNITION_AI
cd vision-ai-project

# Open the notebook in Google Colab and run
```
Upload an image to test predictions with the trained Cats vs. Dogs model.
